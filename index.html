 <h2>Short presentation about me!</h2>
    <p>
   Hello everyone, I'm studiant in first year at Iéseg School of Management and 2 times per week I help middle school students do their homework and revise for their tests. Subsequently, I would like to specialize in digital marketing so that I can work in advertising.

 <h3>My projects:</h3>
  	<p>
  	One of my biggest projects in the future would be to create my own communications and advertising company. The latter would be unique and special in the fact that each project carried out by my communication agency would be carried out with the help of AI and its evolution.
  	<p>
 <h3>My hobbies:</h3>
    <p>
    For me, sport is essential to my well-being. In fact, I have been practicing it since I was very young and I have been able to play many sports such as judo, tennis or even football. Also, I enjoy listening to music and watching series (Prison Break is the best!).
    <p>
  <h3>My passions:</h3>
  	<p>
  	Traveling is indeed one of my greatest passions. Discovering new countries, new cultures and mentalities is a fascinating thing in my opinion. I am looking forward to my university exchange! Also, I'm really passionate about advertising design and the thinking behind each advertisement, it's an exciting field that continues to evolve over time and is never the same. Advertising evolves over time and with technological advances, the means of distribution also evolve.
